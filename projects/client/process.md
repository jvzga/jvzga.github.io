## Work Timeline
12/19/26
Met with client to dicuss on how they would like their website
-Have a welcome page 
-Have a gallery for customers to view the options that the bakery has
-Have a order form (might have to develop backend later if im able) so that customers can order
(Insert quick storyboard later)

12/20/26
Started researching on how to use a form for ordering, backend dev for data is not required as of now but will probably later if it would customers would like to order online rather than by phone. Lots of options like fieldset, form, with attributes like select="x" and radio, lots of ways it can be used but takes a bit to impliment and work with. Will take some time to tinker with to get it set up but it will be a very good job for the client's needs

12/22/26
Started basic framework with the website, setup order form page, gallery, and welcome pages.
-Will need to request pictures for the gallery so customers can see what they will order
-setup some styling in the meantime to have a view on how the color for the website will look

12/23/26
Met with client again and showed them the basic framework of the website
-Progress was going along smoothly and client is happy that everything has been going along so far, so far they are deciding on what colors the website should be using

12/24-25/26
Snow storm came in over the weekend and my files did not save properly so I lost a majority of my progress and was busy with completing other types of works, will rewrite most of my code anyway because I've been experimenting a bit with the order form development page

12/27/26
Finished the majority of order form, took lots of troubleshooting and experimenting to get something looks nice, updated some of the style.css so that the forms looks nice, will probably be finished tomorrow, just need some photos and add some details for home page and gallery. Order form might need a makeover but it works fine, just appearence might need be tinkered with a bit and could be done within a few hours.
